There is currently little work being done in developing of digital ontologies, particularly that of the folklore of Western Visayas. Thus, the researchers aimed to create a chatbot that is able to provide insights and details regarding Panayanon folk narratives which include, myths, legends, and folk tales. Specifically, the researchers aimed for the creation of a knowledge base of Panayanon folk narratives, and subsequently, development and training of a chatbot to understand and answer inquiries about Panayanon folk narratives.
